# Seat_Forecasting

Developed by Pirate-Emperor, Seat_Forecasting is a Python-based machine learning application, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, that predicts future restaurant visitor numbers and manages seat reservations accordingly.

## Features

- **Visitor Forecasting**: Utilizes historical visitor data and machine learning models to forecast the number of visitors for future dates.
- **Seat Reservation System**: Provides users with the ability to make seat reservations based on the predicted number of visitors.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the restaurant data for machine learning.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances the dataset by creating new features that could improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models using historical visitor data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the forecasting models using suitable metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots and charts to display historical data, predictions, and seat reservations.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Seat_Forecasting.git
cd Seat_Forecasting
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `Seat_Forecasting.ipynb` file and open it.

Execute the cells in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, make predictions, manage seat reservations, and display visualizations.

## Data Source

The project uses historical visitor data from a restaurant reservation system. You can replace the dataset with your own historical visitor data or data from a different reservation system.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the Jupyter Notebook (`Seat_Forecasting.ipynb`). Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Implementing more advanced machine learning models and algorithms for visitor forecasting.
- Enhancing the seat reservation system with additional features such as table preferences and special accommodations.
- Developing a user interface for restaurant staff and customers to interact with the reservation system.
- Expanding the application to include features such as menu recommendations and customer loyalty programs.
